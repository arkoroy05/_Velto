# 🧠 Velto: Your AI Brain That Remembers Everything

## **The Problem It Solves**

**Context Fragmentation & Knowledge Loss Across AI Tools**

Every time you switch between AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.), you lose your conversation history, context, and accumulated knowledge. You're forced to:

- **Re-explain** your project details repeatedly
- **Re-debug** the same issues across different AI platforms
- **Re-establish** context for every new conversation
- **Lose** valuable insights and solutions from previous AI interactions

This creates massive inefficiency, wasted time, and prevents knowledge compounding across your AI-powered workflow.

## **What Velto Does**

Velto creates a **universal memory layer** that connects all your AI tools, allowing you to:

### 🎯 **Capture & Store Everything**
- **Select context** from any AI conversation and save it instantly
- **Monitor full conversations realtime** automatically across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and more
- **Store code snippets**, debugging sessions, and technical discussions
- **Capture insights** and solutions for future reference

### 🔄 **Share Context Across AI Tools**
- **Access your entire AI history** from any AI platform
- **Continue conversations** where you left off, regardless of which tool you're using
- **Reference previous solutions** without re-explaining the problem
- **Build on past insights** instead of starting from scratch

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Organization & Discovery**
- **Automatic categorization** of contexts (code, documentation, research, ideas, tasks)
- **Semantic search** to find related conversations and solutions
- **Smart tagging** and project organization
- **AI-generated insights** from your accumulated knowledge

### 💰 **Web3 Token Economy**
- **AICT tokens** represent AI context window capacity
- **Purchase tokens** with ETH to expand your memory storage
- **Tokenized access** to premium memory features
